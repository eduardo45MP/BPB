## Choice of Web Framework

We propose the use of either Flask (Python) or Express (JavaScript) as the web framework for this project. Both frameworks are well-suited for developing web applications and provide the necessary tools to create a robust and scalable personal blog.

1. **Flask (Python):**
   - Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
   - It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard, making it easy to integrate with different web servers.
   - Flask's simplicity and ease of use make it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized projects.

2. **Express (JavaScript):**
   - Express is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, making it ideal for building scalable and efficient web applications.
   - It simplifies the process of creating robust APIs, which can be beneficial for handling data interactions in the blog.
